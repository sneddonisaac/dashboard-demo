## Set up instructions:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies: 
    ``
        npm i
    ``
3. Run the project:
    ``
        npm start
    ``
4. Once you have launched the app and navigated to localhost:3000 (or an alternative port at your digression). You will be prompted to 'log in' this is a basic email link system. Once you have sent any feedback I will be deleting the backend and all data along with it.
5. The application will the redirect you to the dashboard once you have signed in and allow you to navigated between different destinations. The components discussed will be on the Feed and Games pages but there is also the account page and dashboard.
6. Enjoy.
